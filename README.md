My Personal Site Part

This repo contains the folders and files associated with an updated mock personal website.

The purpose of this website is to demonstrate an improved knowledge of html and css, incorporating more advanced techniques than those of the first personal website. A contact form is also going to be added to the website, demonstrating a knowledge of html forms.
